A Project to create a simulation for a feedback page of any e-commerce, customer services website or any other business that provides an applicative service.
The purpose of this project is to learn well the basics of the React library.

## Technologies

👉 REACT.JSX

👉 CSS3

## Implementation Remarks

1️⃣ I have added to the project 6 main components that will help me perform the task in a simpler:

1. Header - Contains the site title.
2. FeedbackForm - Contains the form where feedback is added/edited.
3. FeedbackItem - Contains a single feedback from those shown on the screen.
4. FeedbackList - Contains the complete feedback list.
5. FeedbackStats - Displays the statistics of the feedback list (average and number of feedbacks).
6. RatingSelect - Shows the different rating options within the form.

2️⃣ I used the routing library 'react-router-dom' version v6.

3️⃣ I used a single context within which I held the state and data on the feedback list and all the functions in which I execute http commands to the backend services.

4️⃣ I used the Joi library to validate the feedback input.
